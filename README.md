# html-ajax-demo

This is a collection of (relatively) simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript examples to demonstrate how to use these in developing user interfaces. 

basic.html and sarie.html are the simplest of the lot. These two examples show how to make an HTML page that includes a CSS for styling, and a JavaScript for UI behavior. Each of these examples has a corresponding .css and .js of the same name (e.g. basic.css, basic.js).

index.html connects to a [couchDB ](http://couchdb.apache.org/) database (at demo.ethoinformatics.com) using jQuery to get data and fill in some of the HTML elements, particularly input fields.

index-map.html is an extension of index.html, and includes a map generated by geoJSON data in the database. 

Both index.html and index-map.html use the same .js and .css.

couch.html is an example demonstrating how to use all of the CouchDB HTML calls: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This example is a simplified version of [couch-document-editor](https://github.com/ethoinformatics/couch-document-editor). The functionality is basically the same, but the JS is written more for beginners.
